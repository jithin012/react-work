/**
    max width - Desktop first
    min-width - mobile first

    Media query should write at the end. Why?
    Order of code is matters, so don't add any importance or specifity to selector

    Mobile First - 
    Prons:
        1. Optimised for mobile expe.
        2. Reduce website and apps to the absolute esstntials
        3. Results in smaller, faster and more effciend producrs
        4. prioritze content over aesthetic design, which may be desirable
    
    Cons:
        1. The desktop vertion might feel overly empty and simplistic
        2. More difficult and counterintuitive to develop
        3. Less creative freedom, making it more difficult to create distinctive products
        4. Clients are used to see a desktop version of the site as a prototype
        5. Do your user even use the mobile internet? What's the prupose of your website
